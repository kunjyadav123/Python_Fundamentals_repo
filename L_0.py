# We Know fundamentantals of loops so we will practice as much as we can and make things note down which are important to grab.
# Here again be attentive about the indentataion and scope of conditions and loops scope and .  
# If print statement executed outside the scope of loop it will print last loops executed value ! i guess you got it ! 


# Quick fact : do you know why the printed values in for loop executes in diffrenet lines because in scope of for loop print statement has bydefault end = "\n" thats why it happens but if we put  other thing it will get in such way.
